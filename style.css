Uncut now uses Sass by default. If you prefer using regular CSS,
then feel free to modify this theme how you like and keep a copy
as your own personal starting point.

Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you are going to be working with Sass, that you work locally.
The browsers don't understand Sass and compiling it on the server takes a bit
of a setup.

That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with a
pre-processor: (You really only need one of them)

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)

Compass App: (Windows / Mac Users)
http://compass.handlino.com/

These applications compile Sass into valid CSS. This
way you can keep your production files easy to read and your
CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the output to the
library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

You can also setup auto compiling with Grunt or using Terminal on
OSX. It's a bit complicated to setup so if you aren't familiar
with it, just get one of the automated applications.

---------------------------------------------------------------

If using Sass is still a bit confusing for you, then remove it
and customize this template as you see fit.

If you're a bit uneasy about using Sass or just want a familiar setup,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

WordPress Probz
So Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
is constantly telling me that it needs these classes in the CSS even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css.
So we're gonna drop these here to keep it happy.
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
